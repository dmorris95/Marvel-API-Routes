Welcome to the Marvel React API with Routes

This application uses Axios to make API calls to the Marvel API. Before running the application ensure you get a timestamp, public apikey and a hash in order to connect to the Marvel API. This application builds upon the previous Marvel API using routes. Ensure you have react-router-dom installed in the application before attempting to run.

The public and private keys can be gathered from the Marvel website. The hash is an MD5 hash of your timestamp, private key, and public key
